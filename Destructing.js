/* Use Array and Object Destructing in JavaScript
The destructing assignment is a cool feature that came along with ES6.
Destructing is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values 
from arrays,or properties fro objects, into distinct variables.
That is, we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.
